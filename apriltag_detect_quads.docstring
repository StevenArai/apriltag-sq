Detects quads in the input image and returns a list of them.

This method is useful for debugging the quad detection process or for applications
that only require finding rectangular shapes in an image, without decoding them
as AprilTags.

Args:
    image (numpy.ndarray): A grayscale image (2D numpy array with dtype=uint8).

Returns:
    list: A list of numpy arrays. Each element in the list is a 4x2 numpy array
          representing the four corners of a detected quad in pixel coordinates.
          The corners are ordered counter-clockwise.
